Read up about Context Stores in React. Then try out Zustand (a context store), and use it to create a Note Taking App.

The note taking app should have 3 routes:

1. Pinned notes at /pinned
2. All notes at /all
3. Create a note at /create

When someone creates a note, save it in the Zustand store.

Optionally, you can also try to call a jokes API to display developer jokes at an empty place on the screen (wherever you see fit).

Try to use MUI package in React. If not, you atleast need to have a consistent design, that's what the main focus of this project should be.

Resources you can read up:

1. https://refine.dev/blog/zustand-react-state/
2. https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/installation/

You can leave this project incomplete, but try to get atleast the basic functionalities correct.

And yes, PLEASE host it online somewhere so that we can see it.

Additional brownie points for good productÂ thinking
